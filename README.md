# Second-Calculator
2nd attempt at programming a Calculator

1st attempt was successful but code was sloppy

The goal of this calculator is to function as closely to a calculator on your phone, or one that you hold in your hand. 
It functions, within it's limitations, properly.

Operations available at this time are add, subtract, multiply, and divide. 2018.11.26
